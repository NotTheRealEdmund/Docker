Take note:
Before every session, first remember to run the Docker Quickstart Terminal app from your desktop

C++ side:
Create a main.cpp file

Docker side:
Copy and paste the Dockerfile file, make changes where necessary
Build the docker image using: docker build -t docker-cpp-image .
From this image, we can then create containers using it as a blueprint and run it
docker run docker-cpp-image
Now the app will be run inside the docker container and can be self-contained with its required Clang environment

Docker commands:
See all images: docker images
Remove an image: docker rmi [IMAGE ID]
See all containers: docker ps --all
See running containers: docker ps
Start an existing container which is stopped: docker start [CONTAINER ID]
Stop a running container: docker stop [CONTAINER ID]
See the public facing port of container: docker port [CONTAINER ID]
Remove a container: docker rm [CONTAINER ID]
