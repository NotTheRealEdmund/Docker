Take note:
Before every session, first remember to run the Docker Quickstart Terminal app from your desktop

Python Flask side:
Create an app.py file
Once you've finished coding, if you want to run app.py on its own,
Use: python app.py, it will be exposed through localhost:5000

Docker side:
Create a requirements.txt file to hold dependencies, in this case only Flask and its version number
Copy and paste the Dockerfile file, make changes where necessary
Build the docker image using: docker build -t docker-flask-image .
From this image, we can then create containers using it as a blueprint
docker run -p 9000:5000 docker-flask-image
Now the web app will be run inside the docker container and will be exposed through 192.168.99.100:9000
even though the container is mapping from localhost:5000
Note that docker is configured to use the default machine with IP 192.168.99.100, not localhost anymore
The machine's IP address is stated every time you run the Docker Quickstart Terminal app from your desktop

Docker commands:
See all images: docker images
Remove an image: docker rmi [IMAGE ID]
See all containers: docker ps --all
See running containers: docker ps
Start an existing container which is stopped: docker start [CONTAINER ID]
Stop a running container: docker stop [CONTAINER ID]
See the public facing port of container: docker port [CONTAINER ID]
Remove a container: docker rm [CONTAINER ID]
